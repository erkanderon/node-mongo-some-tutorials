Exercise (Instructions): Understanding Node Modules

Objectives and Outcomes

In this exercise, you will learn about writing Node applications using JavaScript and also learn about the basics of Node modules. At the end of this exercise, you will be able to:

Write a simple Node application in JavaScript.
Understand the basics of Node modules and write simple file-based Node modules
Starting a Node Application

Create a folder named node-examples at a convenient location on your computer, and move to that folder.
Create a file named simplerect.js and add the following code to this file:

*CODE SAMPLE*

var rect = {
  perimeter: function (x, y) {
           return (2*(x+y));
  },
  area: function (x, y) {
            return (x*y);
  }
};
function solveRect(l,b) {
    console.log("Solving for rectangle with l = " + l + " and b = " + b);
    if (l < 0 || b < 0) {
        console.log("Rectangle dimensions should be greater than zero:  l = "
               + l + ",  and b = " + b);
    }
    else {
  console.log("The area of a rectangle of dimensions length = "
               + l + " and breadth = " + b + " is " + rect.area(l,b));
  console.log("The perimeter of a rectangle of dimensions length = "
               + l + " and breadth = " + b + " is " + rect.perimeter(l,b));
    }
}
solveRect(2,4);
solveRect(3,5);
solveRect(-3,5);

*CODE FINISH*

To run the Node application, type the following at the prompt:

*CODE SAMPLE*

     node simplerect

*CODE FINISH*

A Simple Node Module

Now, create a file named rectangle-1.js, and add the following code to it:

exports.perimeter = function (x, y) {
        return (2*(x+y));
}
exports.area = function (x, y) {
        return (x*y);
}
Then, create another file named solve-1.js and add the following code to it:

*CODE SAMPLE*

var rect = require('./rectangle-1');
function solveRect(l,b) {
    console.log("Solving for rectangle with l = " + l + " and b = " + b);
    if (l < 0 || b < 0) {
        console.log("Rectangle dimensions should be greater than zero:  l = "
               + l + ",  and b = " + b);
    }
    else {
  console.log("The area of a rectangle of dimensions length = "
               + l + " and breadth = " + b + " is " + rect.area(l,b));
  console.log("The perimeter of a rectangle of dimensions length = "
               + l + " and breadth = " + b + " is " + rect.perimeter(l,b));
    }
}
solveRect(2,4);
solveRect(3,5);
solveRect(-3,5);

*CODE FINISH*

To run the Node application, type the following at the prompt:

*CODE SAMPLE*

     node solve-1

*CODE FINISH*

Conclusions

In this exercise, you learnt about writing simple Node applications in JavaScript. Thereafter you learnt about writing a basic Node module and use it within your Node application.
